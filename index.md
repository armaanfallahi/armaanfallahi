I’m **Armaan Fallahi**, an MD–PhD trainee at the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children.  
My research focuses on how early-life stress reshapes amygdala circuits and memory engrams.  
I am passionate about combining medicine, neuroscience, and advocacy to help people with brain and mind-related conditions.
